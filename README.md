Your project is a Task and Payment Management Dashboard built using React with Bootstrap for styling. It includes several key features:

Dashboard UI: Displays project cards that show project names, due dates, and statuses (active/completed). The earnings overview section includes a chart showing earnings data for the last few months.

Project Management: Users can add new projects through a form, update existing ones, and delete projects. The list of projects is dynamically rendered on the dashboard.

Payment Management: This section allows users to add payments with details like amount, status (paid/unpaid), and date. Users can mark payments as paid or delete them.

Chart Display: Monthly earnings are displayed using a bar chart. Payment amounts are mapped to specific months, helping users track earnings visually.

Dark and Light Mode: The app includes a switch for toggling between dark and light themes, providing a flexible user experience.

The project focuses on a clean and functional UI, integrating dynamic data with React components.
